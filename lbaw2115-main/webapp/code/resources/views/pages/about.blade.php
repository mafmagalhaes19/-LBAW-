    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
    The main goal of the Event Pointer project is the development of a web-based system to allow our users better control the events they are involved in. We're mainly developing this app with college students in mind, but it can be used by anyone hosting or participating in an event. Our intention is to give them the means to fit events into with their own busy schedules in a simple manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    Providing the end-user with a simple, quick and effective way to host and control their events, along with allowing participants to easily find information about every aspect of the events they're enrolled in, or simply interested in possibly participating, is our main goal.
