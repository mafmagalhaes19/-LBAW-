# ER: Requirements Specification Component

Providing the end-user with a **simple**, **quick** and **effective** way to host and control their events, along with allowing participants to easily find information about every aspect of the events they're enrolled in, or simply interested in possibly participating, **is our main goal**.

## A1: Event Pointer

The main goal of the Event Pointer project is the development of a web-based system to allow our users better control the events they are involved in.
 
We're mainly developing this app with college students in mind, but it can be used by anyone hosting or participating in an event.

Our intention is to give them the means to fit events into with their own busy schedules in a simple manner.

The app will hold data related to the events in the platform, their type or tag, the place they will be held at, dates, durations, among others, varying with the type of event.

### Users

Our application will have 3 different types of users:

**Visitors** can search and view events, create an account in the system using an email and password (or an external OAuth API) and sign in using an email and password (or external OAuth API), gaining access to privileged information in the process.

**Members** can search and view events, but can also create public or private events, and invite other members to their private events.
They can freely request to join public events created by other members.
Members can also manage their sent invitations and the ones they have received, having the option to deny the invitation or accept it, joining the private event that invitation refers to.
Members can manage events they are the hosts of (delete them, create event announcements, change their date, place, description and maximum number of participants).
Other actions the members can take are seeing and editing their profile page, commenting on the event discussion and voting on event announcements and discussion comments, edit or delete their previously made comments, access data about the events they're enrolled in (their date, place, description and participating members) and report events for breaking the ToS or rules.

**Administrators** can search and view events, manage user accounts (edit their email, username and profile pic url, or even delete the user account), manage participating users (remove them from the list of participants) and comments in the discussion (delete them) on events, review event reports and delete events.

### Events and Hosting

***Events*** have at least one Host, and may exist without participants.
A Member who is a host does not have to participate in it, but for the event to start, it must have at least a minimum number of participants (specified by the host).
Hosts can remove members from the participant list, and manage comments on the event's discussion.

### Searching

Administrators, Members and Visitors can search for events by type or tag, name, place, dates or duration.

Events can be filtered by full or empty events, and be sorted by date or duration.

## A2: Actors and User stories

This artifact contains the specification of the actors and their user stories, serving as agile documentation of the projectâ€™s requirements.

### 2.1 Actors

For the **Event Pointer** project, the actors can be represented as shown in the following picture **(Figure 1)** and are described in **Table 1**. <p>
![Event Pointer actors diagram](actors_diagram.svg)
<br><small><b> Figure 1: Event Pointer actors diagram.</b></small>

<br/>

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| **User** | Generic user that has access to public event information.|
| **Visitor** | Non-authenticated users who have no privileges whatsoever, but can browse through public events, and see their details. Can become a member after signing in or registering itself in the system. |
| **Member** | Authenticated user able to create events or participate in existing events. Each member has their own user page.  |
| **Host** | Registered Member who is hosting an event. |
| **Participant** | Registered Member who attends an event. Participants are allowed to make, edit and delete discussion comments they made on an event's discussion.|
| **Administrator** |Overlook the app and its events, making sure it works as intended at all times, and modify the data of events.|
| **OAuth API**  | 	External OAuth API that can be used to register/authenticate eg. Google's authentication service, Steam's authentication service, Origin's authentication service or Battle.net's authentication service.  |

## A3: Information Architecture

This artifact shares the information architecture of the system to be developed, such as identification of the content, how it is organized and made available, and how it is presented to the user. In order to clarify the main ideas of this artifact it is divided into two parts:
1. A sitemap defining how pages are organized from the viewpoint of the users.
2. Content of two main individual screens (wireframes) with description and prioritization of the functionally.

### 3.1 Sitemap

The **Event Pointer** project is organized in some main areas which are: static pages that provide general information about the system (FAQ, Contacts, About), the pages used to explore events (Events' search pages and View Event Tag, Event Catalog, Information, and Management ), the member/user pages (Member Profile, Member Management and Member Search) and the pages with administration features (Administrator Page).
